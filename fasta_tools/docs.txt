Help on module fasta_getters:

NAME
    fasta_getters

DESCRIPTION
    # methods that get return information from a fasta file
    # methods do not modify the original file

FUNCTIONS
    get_entry(identifier, fasta_file)
        Get an entry of fasta file with a line number or a header keyword
        If keyword is not unique the first hit will be returned
        Both ints and str identifiers will return the target line and the
        next line as a tuple
    
    get_fasta_headers(fasta_file, header_character='>')
        returns all headers in given fasta file
        headers found using defualt header start character, '>'
        to chane this pass character to header_character
    
    make_indexed_fasta(fasta_file)
        takes fasta file, returns a dictionary where keyword
        is line number (int) and value is string at that line
        line numbers start from 0

NAME
    fasta_readers

FUNCTIONS
    chunk(l, n)
        Yield successive n-sized chunks from l.

Help on module fasta_writers:

NAME
    fasta_writers

FUNCTIONS
    write_from_dictionary(fasta_dict, output_name)
        writes fasta file from dictionary, assumes key = header, seq = value
    
    write_from_list(fasta_list, output_name)
        writes fasta file from list [header, seq, header,..]
    
    write_from_tuple_list(fasta_tuples, output_name='tuples.fna')
        writes fasta file from list tuples, [(header, seq)]

Help on module consensus_tools:

NAME
    consensus_tools

FUNCTIONS
    clustalize(rep_elements)
        runs clustal omega to create a clustalized file
    
    embosser(clustalized_file, header)
        runs embosse to create a consensus file of a previously
        clustalized file
    
    format_consensus(consensus_file)
        reformats a consensus file
    
    get_random_elements(elements)
        selects 10 random elements of the family to make fasta file of
        elements should be of one family
    
    make_consensus(fasta_file, output_name='consensus.fna', consensus_header=False, rep_elements=True)
        takes fasta file, runs clustal omega then uses
        embosser to make a consensus sequence returned
        in fasta format. You can also give a header to be used
        in the consensus file, otherwise emboss will rename it with
        a defualt name.
    
    rename_emboss(header, embossed_file)
        renames the defualt emboss given header in the consensus fasta
        to a user supplied one

    current_dependencies = ['em_cons', 'clustalo']

Help on module fasta_formater:

NAME
    fasta_formater

FUNCTIONS
    check_1h1s_error(fasta_list)
        Checks fasta in list format for a 1h1s error
        returns true if present and false otherwise
    
    check_carrot_error(fasta_list)
        Checks if all headers begins with >
    
    check_formating(fasta_file, overwrite=True)
        runs all existing format check and fix methods, will expand as needed
        by defualt a fasta file with errors found in it will be overwritten
        but you can edit this action by setting overwrite to false, this will
        return a tuple of error types but will make no corrections
    
    correct_1h1s_error(fasta_list)
        takes fasta file in list format that has multible sequence
        line per header and returns a zipped list of headers and corresponding
        complete sequences
    
    write_fasta_from_zip(zipped_list, output_name)
