Python package built for downloading through github as a way to easily access fasta file related methods

Credit to bast for the https://github.com/bast/somepackage repository which I used as the guide

Use the command
```
pip install git+https://github.com/EthanHolleman/fasta_tools
```
To install the package, I'll probably be editing the fasta parsing/editing/reading files often with no warning so enjoy. In case for some reason you really want the latest version of this fasta_tools uninstall using pip then reinstall 
```
pip uninstall git+https://github.com/EthanHolleman/fasta_tools
```
