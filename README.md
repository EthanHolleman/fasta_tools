# fasta_tools
### A personal python package to explore package making

Python package built for downloading through github as a way to easily access fasta file related methods

Credit to bast for the https://github.com/bast/somepackage repository which I used as the guide

Use the command
```
pip install git+https://github.com/EthanHolleman/fasta_tools
```
To install the package, I'll probably be editing the fasta parsing/editing/reading files often with no warning so enjoy. In case for some reason you really want the latest version of this fasta_tools uninstall using pip then reinstall 
```
pip uninstall fasta_tools
```

docs.txt contains the pydoc generated documentation. 

To use the functions in the conensus_tools.py file you should intall clustalo (clustal omega) and emboss.
Ubuntu install commands
'''
sudo apt-get install clustalo
sudo apt-get install emboss
'''
